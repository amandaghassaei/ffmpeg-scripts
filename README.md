# ffmpeg-scripts
A collection of ffmpeg scripts I'm using to generate gifs and mp4

## To use:

First make all the scripts in the directory executable.

```sh
cd ffmpeg-scripts-main
chmod +x *.sh
```

All batch scripts require a directory be passed in as an argument:

```sh
./batch_convert_mp4_to_gif.sh PATH_TO_DIRECTORY
```
